<h1>The best movies according to me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Raid</h3>
<p>The best action movie that I've watched it's really different than the other action movies because of the fight scenes that they don't let hit themselves like in the western action movies</p>
<h3>The gangster, the cop, and the devil</h3>
<p>A nice movie that the gangster and the cops chose to team up just to catch this murderer that causes a mess in their lives</p>
<h3>The Outlaws</h3>
<p>Best Gangs vs Gangs that you can watch</p>
